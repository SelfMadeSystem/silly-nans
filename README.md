# Shoghi Simon's Silly Shenanigans

This is a collection of fancy effects and animations that I've created using HTML, CSS, SVG, and JavaScript over the years. I noticed that I've been creating a lot of these for projects I've worked on, and I thought it would be fun to compile them all in one place. I hope you enjoy them!
