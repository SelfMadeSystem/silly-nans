import HexThing from '../../components/HexCanvas';

<div class="mr-auto w-fit max-w-lg rounded-xl p-4 pl-8 text-white backdrop-blur-sm">
  I made this neon animated hexagonal effect thing for the [UdeMHacks](https://udemhacks.com/) website. I got the
  initial design from [this CodePen](https://codepen.io/towc/pen/mJzOWJ) , but I rewrote it in TypeScript and added some
  extra features. I tried really hard to make it run only in a fragment shader instead of a 2d canvas, but I couldn't
  get it to work. The original pen had a black background and just fills the screen with low opacity black to have the
  fading effect, but to make it have a transparent background, I had to do some `globalCompositeOperation` shenanigans
  and some GLSL magic. Just doing `globalCompositeOperation` doesn't fully work because leftover pixels from the
  previous frame will still be there. I use the shader to not render any pixels that are too transparent.
