import Idk from '../../components/ShaderCanvas';

<div class="mx-auto max-w-xl p-4 rounded-lg text-white backdrop-blur-md">
  A shader that with frame fading. I originally made it for the
  [UdemHacks](https://udemhacks.com/) website, but it turned out being too
  complicated along with some other issues and so it was scrapped. I thought the
  concept was cool enough to put it here though.
