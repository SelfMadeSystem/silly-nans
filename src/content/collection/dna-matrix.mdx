  I made this DNA matrix effect for an initial version of the [UdeMHacks](https://udemhacks.com/) website. We ended up
  not using it, but I still think it looks cool. It uses two layers of matrix effects, one for the darker "behind" part
  and one for the lighter "in front" part. The helix shape is set as the clip path, and the matrix effect is applied to
  the whole thing. I add some moving offset to the matrix effect to make it look like the helix is spinning.
