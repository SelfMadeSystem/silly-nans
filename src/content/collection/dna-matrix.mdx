  I made this DNA matrix effect for an initial version of the{' '}

  website. We ended up not using it, but I still think it looks cool. It uses two layers of matrix effects, one for the
  darker "behind" part and one for the lighter "in front" part. The helix shape is set as the clip path, and the matrix
  effect is applied to the whole thing. I add some moving offset to the matrix effect to make it look like the helix is
  spinning.
