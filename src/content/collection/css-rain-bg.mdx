<div class="mx-auto w-fit max-w-lg rounded-xl p-4 pl-8 text-white backdrop-blur-sm">
  I made this rain background effect using only CSS `background-image` and `@keyframes` animations.
  This was very difficult to make. Honestly, just look at the source code. This also taught me that
  having 750 animated background-images is not a good idea for performance. :)
